This is the starting template for the basic Java game used as an example and starting point for West Game Creation club.

For basic setup and use:
  - Fork this project into your workspace (a folder where you will keep projects)
  - Open Eclipse, IntelliJ, or another preferred Java IDE, navigate to your workspace folder, and import exsisting project. This points the IDE to your forked project folder
  - Make changes/edits
  - Make a pull request when you are done with your edits. Make sure to accurately describe your work.
